# SeleniumWebDriverCourse
These files represent me following along with Tod Vachev's Udemy course on Selenium with C# located at https://www.udemy.com/seleniumqa/learn/lecture/4566050#overview. 
I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in learning about Selenium. I am enjoying it so far, and it was super cheap thanks to Udemy's regular sales.

## Opera Selenium Driver
At one point I played with doing things using the FireFox, Opera, and IE webdrivers. An updated Opera webdriver was not available in Nuget at the time, so I used the one located at: https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases.
